# Reinforcement Learning

Some exploration scripts and notebooks into RL world with OpenAI/gym and Keras or Pytorch.
Keras-RL is also explored along with my proper DQN implementation.

The toy example environment chosen is the Taxi-v3 for its simplicity and the possibility to work directly with a finite length Q-table.
